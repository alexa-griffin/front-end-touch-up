# front-end-touch-up

I have been feeling that my front end skills are less than optimal, what follows is a collection of experiments fixing that.


## Motivation

The very first real programming I did was in html and css. While some may not consider these "real" programming languages they were my first time telling a computer exactly what I wanted it to do, and I loved it. I was addicted, I came home from school sat down and made a website. To be clear these were very *very* bad, but over time I improved and got to a point where I believe that I was ok, at least as ok as an eleven year old can get. Now that I have moved to more complex applications in various "real" programming languages I feel that I have somewhat lost my sense of design. I don't want that to continue to worsen so here are a collection of designs made in order to prevent that from happening.


## Rules

- no libraries, style, javascript or otherwise
- everything is made by me with the possible exceptions of fonts and images.
- at least 1 per week until I feel ok with what I have done
- good commit messages


## Tooling

I thought about using no tools at all: plain notepad, html, css, and js. Then I realized that I don't enjoy working with bad tools, so instead I am using as minimal a toolset as possible while still being enjoyable to work in.

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
